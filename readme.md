# Saltistic

> Don't get mad, Get salty!

## PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. A NEW VERSION CALLED SALT OVERFLOW HAS STARTED DEVELOPMENT INSTEAD. YOU CAN FIND THE REPO [HERE](https://github.com/tomzmtl/SaltOverflow)

## Installation

If you're not used to run Laravel apps (or PHP apps in general), the easiest route would be to setup Homestead, a Vagrant-based environment tailored for Laravel development.

[Read the official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead).

## Development

```bash
# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# run gulp watch (SASS)
gulp watch

# webpack watch (JS)
webpack --watch
```
